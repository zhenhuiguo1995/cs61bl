I am not a Berkeley student
and I am taking this course online by myself.
The autogarder keeps asking me to given an "explanantion.txt" file which is long enough,
otherwise it will raise an error and my work will not be fairly evaluated.
Hence I have to provide this long and boring paragraph.
Thanks for your patience in reading this file, Mr. autograder.
It would be appreciated, if next time, you could inform me how long this text should be.
You know it's annoying to submit this work again and again, especially under the condition
that this autograder is slow and hard to use.
Have a good day anyway!
